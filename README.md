# rust-btc-parser

This project is a rewrite of https://github.com/gcarq/rusty-blockparser with the latest version of rust and updated dependencies. The puspose is to write a purposeful project while having enough differences to exercise my debugging and library inclusion in rust while allowing me to go through all steps of creating a production project. This is by no means a code for code rewrite and there are several differences between the two projects but the overall purpose is inline with the original project.
